## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 
## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
		s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
            message("getting cached data")
            return(s)
        }
		m <- x$get()
        s <- solve(m)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
}
